name: $bitsAnyClear
description: |-
  The `$bitsAnyClear` operator is used to match documents where any of the bit positions specified in a bitmask are clear (that is, 0). This operator is useful for filtering documents based on at least one bit being unset.
syntax: |-
  {
    <field>: { $bitsAnyClear: <bitmask> }
  }
parameters:
  - name: field
    type: string
    required: true
    description: |-
      The field in the document on which the bitwise operation is to be performed.
  - name: <bitmask>
    type: number
    required: true
    description: |-
      A bitmask where each bit position specifies the corresponding bit position that should be checked for being clear (0).
examples:
  sample: |-
    {
      "_id": "store1",
      "name": "Store Name",
      "storeFeatures": 5
    }
  items:
    - title: Find stores where any specific feature bit is clear
      description: |-
        Matches documents where any of the specified bit positions in the storeFeatures field are clear (0).
      query: |-
        db.stores.find({
          storeFeatures: { $bitsAnyClear: 6 }
        })
      output:
        value: |-
          [
            {
              "_id": "store1",
              "name": "Store Name",
              "storeFeatures": 5
            }
