type: operator
category: geospatial
name: $minDistance
description: Specifies the minimum distance (in meters) that must exist between two points in a geospatial query, useful for finding locations outside a certain radius.
syntax: '{ <location field>: { $near: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [<longitude>, <latitude>] }, $minDistance: <distance_in_meters> } } }'
parameters:
  - name: location field
    type: string
    required: true
    description: The field containing the geospatial data
  - name: coordinates
    type: object
    required: true
    description: Array of [longitude, latitude] specifying the center point
  - name: distance_in_meters
    type: number
    required: true
    description: Minimum distance in meters from the center point
examples:
  items:
    - title: Find stores beyond minimum distance
      description: Find stores at least 500 kilometers away from a reference point
      query: 'db.stores.find({ location: { $near: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [69.7296, 70.1272] }, $minDistance: 500000 } } })'
      output:
        value: Stores located at least 500000 meters (500km) from the specified coordinates
    - title: Minimum distance with field selection
      description: Find distant stores and return only specific fields
      query: 'db.stores.find({ location: { $near: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [69.7296, 70.1272] }, $minDistance: 100000 } } }, { name: 1, location: 1 })'
      output:
        value: Name and location of stores at least 100km from the center point
