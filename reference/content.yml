    - category: aggregation
      description: |-
        Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. They group values from multiple documents, perform operations on the grouped data, and return a single result. Common aggregation tasks include calculating averages, sums, and counts.
    - category: query-and-write
      description: |-
        Query and write operations allow you to retrieve, insert, update, and delete documents in your DocumentDB collections. These operations are fundamental for interacting with your data, enabling you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) tasks efficiently.
- type: operators
  description: |-
    MongoDB Query Language (MQL) operators enable powerful filtering, comparison, and data manipulation within queries. Mastering these operators helps you write expressive queries to efficiently retrieve and update documents in your collections.

    - category: accumulator
      description: |-
        Accumulator operators are used in aggregation pipelines to perform calculations on groups of documents. They take multiple input values and return a single output value, such as sums, averages, minimums, and maximums, enabling complex data analysis within your queries.

    - category: array-expression
    - category: array-query
      description: |-
        Array query operators allow you to perform operations on array fields within your documents. These operators enable you to filter, manipulate, and analyze array data effectively, making it easier to work with complex data structures in your queries.
